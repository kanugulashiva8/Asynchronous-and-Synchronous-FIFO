# Asynchronous_and_Synchronous_FIFO

Tools: Notepad++, Icarus Verilog
• Designed and implemented Synchronous and Asynchronous FIFOs for reliable data buffering, covering both single-clock and
dual-clock domain scenarios.
• Incorporated write/read pointer management, dual-port memory arrays, and full/empty flag logic using techniques such as
extra-bit pointers, reserved slots, and Gray-code conversion.
• Used synchronizers and clock-domain crossing methods in the asynchronous FIFO to handle metastability, ensuring safe data
transfer between independent clocks.
